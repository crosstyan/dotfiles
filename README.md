## Vim File Format

IDK why but git said
```bash
warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in .vim/colors/codedark.vim.
The file will have its original line endings in your working directory
```
If things don't work, try run these in vim. 
```bash
:set fileformat=unix
# or 
:set ff=unix
```
Or this 
```bash
:e ++ff=dos
```
Or this 
```bash
:%s/<Ctrl-V><Ctrl-M>/\r/g
```
Or change it back. I don't exactly know
